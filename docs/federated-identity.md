# Federated Identity

[Federated identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity) refers to
the practices, policies, and protocols that allow identity information to be
shared between two or more distinct domains.  Federated identity enables [single
sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (SSO), which allows a
user to sign in once with a single username and password (or other credential)
and access multiple independent web applications and websites.

Federation requires the cooperation of multiple parties, as identity information
must be shared between the otherwise autonomous security domains that each party
controls and operates.  Due to the high degree of cooperation needed, federated
identity utilizes industry standards and open specifications to help achieve
interoperability.

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) is the recommended protocol to


use
for modern web applications needing federated
