# Introduction

Passport is authentication middleware for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  It is
designed to serve a singular purpose: authenticate requests.  Passport cleanly
encapsulates this functionality, providing a flexible framework supporting a
variety of authentication mechanisms, while delegating unrelated details such as
data access to the application.  Whether you are building a new application or
working on an existing one, this separation of concerns makes Passport extremely
easy to integrate.

In modern web applications, authentication can be performed in a variety of
ways.  Traditionally, users log in by providing a username and password.  For
applications that need a higher level of security, passwords can be augmented
with a [second factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication),
such as a [one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)
(OTP) generated by an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or delivered
via email or SMS.  Recent innovations, encompassed by [Web Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn)
(WebAuthn), are eliminating the need for passwords entirely using biometric
sensors and [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

Use of [single sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (SSO)
allows users to avoid creating a new account, instead letting them sign in with
an existing account they already have.  In consumer applications, users are
accustomed to signing in with [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/).
In enterprise settings, users sign in using their corporate [identity provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider)
(IdP).  SSO is achieved by using federated identity protocols such as [OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_%28OIDC%29)
and [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language).

Every application has unique requirements, and can make use of any of these
authentication mechanisms, in any combination.  In Passport, authentication
mechanisms are packaged as individual modules known as strategies.  Applications
install only the packages they need, without introducing unnecessary
dependencies.

Passport reduces the complexity of authenticating a request to a simple
statement:

```javascript
app.post('/login/password', passport.authenticate('local'));
```

Hidden behind that simple statement are three fundamental concepts:

  1. Middleware
  2. Strategies
  3. Sessions
  
The remainder of this introduction provides an overview of these concepts,
explaining how they fit together within Passport.  This guide will then examine
commonly used strategies in detail.  After reading this guide, you will have an
understanding of how Passport works when authenticating requests to your
application.
