# Introduction

Passport is authentication middleware for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  It is
designed to serve a singular purpose: authenticate requests.

What Passport does is equaled in importance by what it _does not_.  Passport
does not mount routes in your application.  Similarly, Passport does not impose
data models on your application.  The URL structure and database schema of an
application are best determined by you, the developer of that application.

Passport delegates responsibilities such as data access to the application.
This separation of concerns makes Passport extremely flexible, as well as easy
to integrate.  If you are building a new application, the patterns in Passport
encourage clean and maintainable code.  If you have an existing application, the
code and data that exists can be reused with little to no changes.

In modern web applications, authentication may be performed using a variety of
mechanisms.  Traditionally, users log in by providing a username and password.
This continues to be the primary method of authentication in most applications
today.

[Single sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (SSO), powered by
federated identity protocols such as [OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_%28OIDC%29)
and [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language),
enables people to authenticate using an account they already have, reducing the
need for yet another password.  The popularity of social networking has brought
the convenience of SSO to consumer applications, by signing in with [Google](https://www.google.com/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).  In
enterprise applications, these protocols allow people to sign in using their
corporate [identity provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider) (IdP).

The need for higher levels of security can be achieved, in part, through
[multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)
(MFA).  A [one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)
(OTP), such as those generated by Google Authenticator, or use of a security key
or fingerprint sensor adds additional methods of authentication, increasing the
confidence that the correct person is signing in.

While each of these authentication mechanisms is important, they represent only
a fraction of the features necessary for a complete [identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management)
system.  Identity-as-as-service (IDaaS) vendors, such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/),
save developers the time and effort necessary to build and maintain such systems.
IDaaS platforms can be integrated into applications using APIs and standard
protocols such as OpenID Connect.

Passport recognizes that each application has unique authentication
requirements.  Authentication mechanisms, known as _strategies_, are packaged as
individual modules.  These strategies can be used to address all of the above
situations and more.  Applications can choose which strategies to employ,
meeting necessary requirements without introducing unnecessary dependencies.

Despite the complexities involved in authentication, code does not have to be
complicated.

```javascript
app.post('/login/password', passport.authenticate('local'));
```

In making authentication simple, Passport relies on three important concepts:

  1. Middleware
  2. Strategies
  3. Sessions
  
The remainder of this introduction will provide an overview of these concepts,
after which various types of strategies will be examined in detail, providing an
understanding of how to build authentication into your application.
