Passport is authentication middleware for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any
[Express](https://expressjs.com/)-based web application.  A comprehensive set of
strategies support authentication using a [username and password](/docs/username-password/),
[Facebook](/docs/facebook/), [Twitter](/docs/twitter/), and [more](/packages/).
