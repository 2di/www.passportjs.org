## Setup

Before you dive in, you'll need a working development environment with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), and an editor and terminal of your choosing.  Take
a moment to set up these tools if you have not already done so.

Let's clone the app we'll use as a starting point:

```sh
$ git clone <url-here> username-password-tutorial
```

You now have a directory named `'username-password-tutorial'`.  Let's `cd` into
it:

```sh
$ cd username-password-tutorial
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

And start the server:

```
$ npm start
```

Let's check to see if its working.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
in your browser.
