  Apple Touch Icons
  
  Adds an icon that will be used by Safari on iOS when a link is added to the
  Home screen. Such links are known as Web Clips.
  
  Multiple icons are specified for different device resolutions. Apple's
  guidance on sizes is scattered, but the following table illustrates which size
  is used by various devices.
  
    57x57    iPhone (iOS 6.1 and earlier)
    60x60    iPhone
    72x72    iPad (iOS 6.1 and earlier)
    76x76    iPad
    114x114  iPhone with Retina display (iOS 6.1 and earlier)
    120x120  iPhone with Retina display
    144x144  iPad with Retina display (iOS 6.1 and earlier)
    152x152  iPad with Retina display
    167x167  iPad Pro
    180x180  iPhone with Retina HD display
  
  If not otherwise specified, the system searches for a file named
  'apple-touch-icon.png'.
